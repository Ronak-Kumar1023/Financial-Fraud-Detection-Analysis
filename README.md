# Financial Fraud Detection Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using a dataset generated from the PaySim Simulator. The analysis explores various transaction types, identifies fraudulent activity, and visualizes patterns to assist in improving fraud detection systems.

## Key Features

- **Dataset**: Contains mobile money transactions categorized by types such as CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, and TRANSFER.
- **Fraud Detection**: Analysis of key fraud detection fields â€” `isFlaggedFraud` (flagged by the system) and `isFraud` (truly fraudulent transactions).
- **Visualization**: Provides insights into transaction types, fraud distribution, and behavioral patterns using custom visualizations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data processing and analysis
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization

## Outcomes

- Identification of common characteristics in fraudulent transactions.
- Comparative analysis of system-detected fraud (flagged) vs. actual fraud.
- Enhanced understanding of fraud patterns for improved detection algorithms.

## Conclusion

This project contributes to the development of more accurate fraud detection systems by analyzing transaction patterns and improving the identification of fraudulent behavior.
